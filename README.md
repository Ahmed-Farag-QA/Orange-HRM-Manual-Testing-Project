# 🧪 OrangeHRM - Manual Testing Project

This repository contains a comprehensive manual testing suite for the OrangeHRM web application (Open-Source Demo). The project demonstrates the application of software testing methodologies to ensure the application's functionality, usability, and reliability across core human resource management workflows.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to perform end-to-end manual testing on the OrangeHRM platform. Testing focused on critical user journeys, administrative security, edge cases, and UI/UX validation to identify defects, enforce data integrity, and ensure a seamless user experience.

## 🔍 Scope of Testing

* **Authentication Module (Login & Logout):** Verifying session timeouts, cross-tab behavior, invalid credentials handling, and secure logouts.
* **Forgot Password Feature:** Validating security links, username existence checks, error messaging, and input criteria (special characters/spaces).
* **PIM - Add Employee:** Testing strict data validation rules on mandatory fields, profile picture uploads, unique Employee ID generation, and "Create Login Details" logic.
* **PIM - Employee List & Search:** Verifying complex filtering using multiple criteria (Employee Name, ID, Job Title, Sub Unit) and Autocomplete hints.
* **PIM - Reports:** Validating the behavior of system-defined pre-loaded reports, custom report queries, search resets, and record counts.
